<h1>Welcome to Creating Digital Exhibits With Omeka</h1>
<p>This is a very basic set of HTML slides I created for a conference workshop I presented in the fall of 2019.  By creating the slides as a "website," I could project them onscreen as well as allow participants to access them on their own device, both during the workshop and later if desired. </p>
    <p>I've edited them to include the required elements for this assignment.</p>
